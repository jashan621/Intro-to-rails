<h4>For this project i have used 2 datasets</h4>

<h6>Faker Gem:</h6>
The Faker gem is a Ruby library that generates fake data, such as names, addresses, text, and numbers. It is commonly used in development and testing environments to populate databases with sample data.
The data generated by Faker is structured based on the attributes you specify. For example, Faker can generate fake names as strings, fake addresses as strings, and fake numbers within specified ranges.
In the context of my project, the Faker gem is used to populate the Lake model with sample data. Therefore, the required database table is lakes, and the columns required would correspond to the attributes of the Lake model, such as name, description, area, and access.
 The data generated by Faker is standalone and does not require integration with external datasets. However, it serves as a useful tool for populating database with sample data for testing and development purposes.</p2> </br></br>

 <h6>CSV Data:</h6>
<h6> Source: Winnipeg open Data Portal</h6>
 Description: CSV  files are a common format for storing tabular data. In my project, CSV data is being used to import real-world data about lakes, such as their names, descriptions, areas, and access types.
 Structure: The CSV data is structured as rows and columns, where each row represents a lake and each column represents a specific attribute of the lake, such as name, description, latitude, longitude, and access type.
 Required Database Tables and Columns: Similar to the Faker data, the CSV data is used to populate the Lake model. Therefore, the required database table is lakes, and the columns required would correspond to the attributes of the Lake model, such as name, description, area, and access.
 Integration: The CSV data can be integrated into your application by parsing the CSV file and creating records in the lakes table based on the data in the CSV file. This integration allows you to incorporate real-world data into your application and enrich the sample data generated by Faker.</p3>
